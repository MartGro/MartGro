# RNA-RNA Interaction Profiling via High-Troughput Sequencing

RNA-RNA interaction profiling is a method used to identify and analyze the interactions between RNA molecules within a cell. These interactions are crucial for understanding the regulation of gene expression and the roles that various RNAs play in cellular processes. RNA molecules can interact with each other to form complex structures that influence their function, stability, and localization within the cell.

Some notable techniques are: 
-  PARIS (Psoralen Analysis of RNA Interactions and Structures)

- LIGR-seq (Ligation of interacting RNA followed by high-throughput sequencing)

- RIC-seq (RNA In Situ Conformation sequencing)
